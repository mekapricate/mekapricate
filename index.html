      <h2> a sad story about me recently :) </h2>
      <p>So basically I had a crush on this girl which I wont tell, I was madly in love since she got all that I was looking for a girl, but sadly when I confessed she already had a boy friend. I was frustrated now knowing to do.
      All of that feeling were gone, snapped out of existance, it was a sad day, I can't even eat or do anything. I still talk to her at somepoint but its just not the same. Recently my crush of mine got *married* in minecraft??
      Its kinda like when you give your girlfriend a nice present, not a real wedding by the way, so yeah, she invited me, when I saw the message, my soul crushed know I don't have a chance anymore but to move on... But what would
      A good guy would do is accept the invite wholeheartedly, I don't even want to go because I can't stand it, but just to support them, I just accepted it... There they where quote on quote marrying, luckily my mom told me to go 
      To dinner, so I havent watch what was going on... When the wedding was done, I don't know what to do besides coding, talking to friends, and listening to yorushika. But my world just ended, and I had to start anew.
      It was fun experiencing it, after 2 years of admiring her, it's finally done... I don't have to think of her anymore, well sure the hurt and the feelings is still their, but I just want to forget it. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>If you're reading this, thank you for the being my inspiration to go forward, I really liked you, but I have to move on you know? I hope we can talk often. Just thank you. </p>
